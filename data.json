It uses Sass to create a flexible code base that can change easily with any desired changes in styles. Variable, placeholders, and mixins give the multi-tiered file structure of the sass the ability to push any small changes from the variables partial up through to the final CSS stylesheet.",

The HTML required accurate and well organized semantic markup and the CSS uses a grid display with flex-box containers within the grid sections. The Javascript creates the functionality for the interactive notification icon and form elements. This was also my first use of the chart.js library to represent the fictional traffic data. Dashboards like these are useful across industries for better management of resources and understanding user tendencies.",
